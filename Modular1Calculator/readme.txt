MSteps:
1.) CalculatorInitial - All classes in a single module
2.) separate UI, calculator, and operations. This is abstract modules. Talk about benefits (ie. provides default implementation).
3.) ModularCalculatorInitial - separate UI, calculator, operations, and math. This is separate abstractions with no default implement. Talk about benefits (ie. configure to run whatwever type of calculator desired).
4.) ModularCalculatorComplete - Add new operations.
5.) ModularCalculatorOSGi
6.) TestCalcUIWithBundles

Need to rename these projects so they make sense. Perhaps put 1, 2, 3...in front of them so they line up correctly in the editor.
